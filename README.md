# Ontology_RAG_System

**Details of the files in the project:**

1. setup.sh: This is the bash file or the main file that executes the entire project.
2. rag_implement_ontology.py: This python file contains functions such as text splitting, ontology generation, storing text in vector store and retrieving data for 
   implementing RAG application.
3. npm_requirements.txt: This txt file contains library for hosting the strealit app. In our case, it is localtunnel.
4. ollama_install_helper_module.py: This python file contains function used for executing terminal commands.
5. requirements.txt: This txt file contains libraries used in the project.
6. app.py: This python file contains the code for UI using streamlit.

**Steps to run the project:**

1. Execute the main bash file(setup.sh) in the terminal using the following command:
   
     **bash setup.sh**
   
   This will install all the dependencies in requirements.txt , npm_requirements.txt and Ollama. Further, it will also run the streamlit app via localtunnel server     and generate the link where the streamlit is 
   hosted.
   
   _**Note:** The installation can take some time. Further, it will also take time to generate ontologies for the text chunks depending on the GPU._
   
2. During running of the setup.sh script, the local tunnel password will be generated.
     Example: Password: 25.21.14.0
     Copy this password and go to the link generated by the local tunnel strealit server as shown in the image.

4. After clicking on the link, paste the password and proceed. The streamlit app opens and lets you interact with the application.
